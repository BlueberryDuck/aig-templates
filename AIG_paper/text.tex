\section{Inconsistency Measurements}
Not all inconsistent knowledgebases contain no information at all or the same amount of, just because they are inconsistent as a whole. This can be deduced as two inconsistent knowledgebases can provide different conclusions, implying they contain different information \cite{bertossi_approaches_2005}.

A binary measure, commonly used for example in classical inference, only provides the information on whether a knowledgebase is consistent or inconsistent. Other logics that can work with inconsistent knowledgebases would profit from more fine-grained measures.
One example of such logic is the quasi-classical logic \cite{grant_measuring_2006} which extends the first-order logic to enable the quantification of equality and more importantly inconsistency in a knowledgebase by determining "degrees of inconsistency".

The fundamental idea of an inconsistency measure is to provide a function \(\mathcal{I}\) that when applied to a knowledgebase \(\mathcal{K}\) is growing in number the more inconsistencies there are in \(\mathcal{K}\). One of the most popular approaches for such a measure is using the number of minimal inconsistent subsets \cite{hunter_measuring_2008}. This approach "counts" the minimal number of formulas needed to depict the inconsistency of the entire set, while also taking into account the proportion of the language that is touched by the inconsistency.\\
So when using a set of all minimal inconsistent subsets of a knowledgebase \(I_{\min}(\mathcal{K})\) one can define an inconsistency measure as \(\mathcal{I}_{\text{MI}}(\mathcal{K}) = \left| I_{\min}(\mathcal{K}) \right|\). This simple approach comes with the advantage of already meeting a number of the basics that an inconsistency measure needs to fulfill, most notably \(\mathcal{I}_{\text{MI}}(\mathcal{K}) = 0\) if \(\mathcal{K}\) is consistent.

Many other inconsistency measures expand on that idea. \cite{jabbour_mis_2016} uses minimal inconsistent subset partitions to be able to differentiate within the subsets how strong conflicts between them are. This means that not all subsets count equally towards the inconsistency score, which provides an even finer measure.

\section{Strong Inconsistency for Non-Monotonic Logics}

"Measuring inconsistency in non-monotonic logics has only recently gained some attention \cite{michael_measuring_2016} \cite{brewka_strong_2017} \cite{ulbricht_measuring_2018} \cite{brewka_strong_2019}"
\\
"a refined notion of inconsistent subsets of a knowledge base K of a possibly nonmonotonic framework has been introduced, called strong K-inconsistency"
\cite{brewka_strong_2017}
\\
"The notion of strong inconsistency generalizes classical inconsistency in a well-behaved manner as it preserves many structural properties e.g. the hitting set duality with maximal consistent sets \cite{reiter_theory_1987}"

\section{Three Measures based on Minimal Inconsistent Sets}
"We consider generalized versions of three measures based on minimal inconsistent sets" in Section 2 of \cite{ulbricht_measuring_2018} and Section 3 of \cite{ulbricht_handling_2020}
\\
"a subset of a knowledge base \(\mathcal{K}\) is strongly inconsistent if all its supersets within \(\mathcal{K}\) are inconsistent as well. Intuitively, one can think of a conflict that cannot be resolved by formulas in \(\mathcal{K}\) itself"
\\
"classical and strong inconsistency coincide whenever our logic is monotonic \cite{brewka_strong_2019}"
\\
"In particular, the notions coincide for monotonic logics, and the existence of a strongly inconsistent subset of \(\mathcal{K}\) is a necessary and sufficient condition for the inconsistency of \(\mathcal{K}\) itself. Moreover, removing from \(\mathcal{K}\) any minimal hitting set of \(SI_{\min}(\mathcal{K})\) yields a maximal consistent subset of \(\mathcal{K}\), which is also known as the hitting set duality in classical logics \cite{reiter_theory_1987}." See \cite{brewka_strong_2017}
\\
"Assume an arbitrary but fixed logic \(L\). In classical inconsistency measurement, minimal inconsistent subsets of a knowledge base play an important role since they can be seen as the “atomic conflicts” within \(\mathcal{K}\). A rather simple but still popular approach to measure inconsistency is thus taking the value \(\left| \mathcal{I}_{\min}(\mathcal{K}) \right|\). The notion of strong inconsistency facilitates the following generalization of this measure to arbitrary logics."

\(\mathcal{I}_{\text{MSI}}: 2^{\text{WF}} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{\infty} \text{ via } \mathcal{I}_{\text{MSI}}(\mathcal{K}) = \left| SI_{\min}(\mathcal{K}) \right|\)

\(\mathcal{I}_{\text{MSI}^\text{C}}: 2^{\text{WF}} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{\infty} \text{ via } \mathcal{I}_{\text{MSI}^\text{C}}(\mathcal{K}) = \sum_{\mathcal{H} \in SI_{\min}(\mathcal{K})} \frac{1}{|\mathcal{H}|}\)
\cite{hunter_measuring_2008}

\(\mathcal{I}_{\text{p}}: 2^{\text{WF}} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{\infty} \text{ via } \mathcal{I}_{\text{p}}(\mathcal{K}) = \left| \bigcup_{\mathcal{H} \in SI_{\min}(\mathcal{K})} \mathcal{H} \right|\)
\cite{liu_measuring_2011}

\section{Rationality Postulates}
"We develop rationality postulates based on previous ones from the literature [...] most of them require refinements" in Section 3 of \cite{ulbricht_measuring_2018} and Section 4 of \cite{ulbricht_handling_2020}
\\
"There is a growing number of rationality postulates for inconsistency measurement but not every postulate is generally accepted \cite{hameurlain_basic_2017} \cite{ferme_revisiting_2014}"
\\
"This becomes apparent when considering the monotony postulate which is usually satisfied by classical inconsistency measures and demands \(\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{K}) \leq \mathcal{I}(\mathcal{K}')\) whenever \(\mathcal{K} \subseteq \mathcal{K}'\) holds, i.e., the severity of inconsistency cannot be decreased by adding new information. However, in nonmonotonic frameworks, adding information may resolve conflicts. It is thus possible that \(\mathcal{K}\) is inconsistent, while \(\mathcal{K}'\) is not, so we would expect \(\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{K}') < \mathcal{I}(\mathcal{K})\) for any reasonable measure \(\mathcal{I}\)."

\section{Repair Knowledgebases}
"We extend the hitting set duality from previous work \cite{brewka_strong_2019} to situations where knowledgebases can be repaired by adding information" in section 7 of \cite{ulbricht_handling_2020}
