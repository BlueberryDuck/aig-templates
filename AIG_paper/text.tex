\section{Non-monotonic logics}
The basis was laid out by \cite{mcdermott_non-monotonic_1980}.

\section{Measuring Inconsistency}
Analyze the distribution of inconsistency within a knowledge base using the Shapely measure \cite{hunter_measure_2010} in the classical case. Measures based on minimal inconsistent sets of a knowledge base \(\mathcal{K}\) \cite{jabbour_mis_2016} were proposed by \cite{ulbricht_measuring_2018}.
